Despite this large difference in video count, banned accounts exhibit much higher statistics for views, likes, and shares. For example, the mean number of likes for banned accounts is 153,017, which is more than twice the mean likes for active accounts, which is 71,037. This pattern is consistent for views and shares as well.\n",
